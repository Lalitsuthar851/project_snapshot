mkdir + folder names =mkdir plus any number of folders can be created by just writing the name of the folder 

{mkdir --parents --verbose dir4/dir5
mkdir -p --verbose dir4/dir5
mkdir -p -v dir4/dir5
mkdir -pv dir4/dir5}     <<this all command are used to create parent folder or parent directory
mkdir -p=minus p that means we are creating file or folder inside the folrd file that's path we have given here .... it means -p creates parent directory too
mkdir "new folder"= if you want to make new folder with spaces in that name  just write that name in quotation mark
